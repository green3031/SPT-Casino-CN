    /// ## Drawn, not photographed
    ///
    /// This began as a photograph with a pocket ring painted over it and was wrong
    /// twice: the photograph had 33 or 34 pockets against the 37 the server settles on,
    /// and the overlay's radii were measured against the image's diameter where they
    /// meant its radius, so the ring came out at double size and burst out of the bowl.
    ///
    /// Everything is drawn now, from the pocket list the server sends. There are 37
    /// pockets because there are 37 pockets, and they are where they are asked to be.
    ///
    /// ## The bowl is still, the head turns
    ///
    /// A real wheel is two pieces. The **bowl** -- the outer rim, the wooden apron and
    /// the track the ball runs on -- never moves. The **head** -- the pockets, the
    /// numbers, the green ring and the cone -- spins inside it. Drawing them as one
    /// picture rotated the track under the ball, so no amount of counter-rotation could
    /// ever have read.
    ///
    /// ## Why the ball looked like it was hitching
    ///
    /// Not the maths. The ball travelled **41 pixels between frames while being 31
    /// pixels wide**, so two consecutive frames never overlapped and the eye saw a row
    /// of separate balls rather than one moving one. Anything that moves more than its
    /// own width per frame strobes, however smooth the function driving it.
    ///
    /// Two rounds of chasing that as a discontinuity found nothing, because there was
    /// nothing to find: a simulation of the exact formulas showed zero direction
    /// reversals. What it did show was the step size. The ball is slower and larger
    /// now, and every constant below is chosen against that ratio -- see
    /// <see cref="StepPerFrame"/>.
    ///
    /// ## Landing is computed, never hoped for
    ///
    /// The ball's position is described **relative to the head**:
    ///
    ///     ballAngle = headAngle + pocketAngle(position) + relative
    ///
    /// where `relative` decays to exactly zero. Early on its decay outruns the head, so
    /// the ball visibly runs the other way; at the end it is zero, so the ball sits in
    /// its pocket and rides round, with no special case to put it there. The decay is
    /// exponential because angular velocity under friction is.
