    /// hideout or the flea market means backing out first. That bar is on every

    ///
    /// **Ported from Blackjack, which solved this first**, and its notes carry a section
    /// addressed at whoever wrote the second mod. Two rules come from there and both are
    /// obeyed below, because both fail quietly rather than loudly:
    ///
    /// 1. **Take the template from `_toggleButtons`**, which holds only the game's own
    ///    tabs. A mod that picks a template geometrically eventually clones the *other*
    ///    mod's tab and inherits its pip and its pile of disabled components. See
    ///    <see cref="Keyed"/> and <see cref="PickTemplate"/>.
    /// 2. **Split the row on the spacer's `flexibleWidth`**, not on the widest gap. Every
    ///    added tab eats the spacer's width, and once two mods have both added one, the
    ///    middle gap is no wider than the gaps between tabs -- at which point measuring
    ///    says the row is one group and the new tab lands on the far right beside
    ///    SETTINGS. See <see cref="Divider"/>.
    ///
    /// Beyond that the two tabs do not have to know about each other at all: the row is a
    /// HorizontalLayoutGroup, so it measures itself every time it is dirtied and a second
    /// added tab simply shifts everything along.
    ///
    /// What the bar actually is, read out of 4.1.3's Assembly-CSharp:
    /// <c>EFT.UI.MenuTaskBar</c>, hanging off the public field of that name on
    /// <c>EFT.UI.PreloaderUI</c> -- a MonoBehaviourSingleton, so it is one static
    /// property away and never needs searching for. Its tabs live in a private
    /// <c>_toggleButtons</c> dictionary keyed by <see cref="EMenuType"/>, and each one is
    /// an <c>EFT.UI.AnimatedToggle</c>, which is a <see cref="Toggle"/> and not a button
    /// at all. That last fact is what most of <see cref="Neuter"/> is about.
    ///
