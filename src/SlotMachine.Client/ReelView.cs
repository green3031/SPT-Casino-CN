    /// The five reels, and the only part of this that is actually hard.
    ///
    /// ## How a real reel moves, and how this one does
    ///
    /// A physical reel is a printed band on a drum. It **snaps up to speed, holds flat
    /// out, then decelerates into its stop and thumps against the detent.** It does not
    /// slow down from the first frame, which is what the first version of this did and
    /// why it read as a wheel winding down rather than a reel being spun.
    ///
    /// So the motion here is a real velocity profile, integrated exactly:
    ///
    /// * `SpinUp` (the first tenth) -- smoothstep from a standstill to full speed.
    /// * flat out until `HoldUntil`, which is most of the spin.
    /// * a squared ease-out into the stop, which is long, and is where the tension is.
    /// * an overshoot of `Overshoot` of a cell, sprung back over `SettleSeconds`. That
    ///   last bounce is the whole difference between stopping and *landing*.
    ///
    /// ## The cells do not move. The symbols do.
    ///
    /// Nine cells sit at fixed positions behind a masked three-cell window and never
    /// move relative to each other. What travels is a **read head** over a strip: cell
    /// *i* shows `strip[i - floor(position)]`, and the whole column slides by the
    /// fractional part of the position. Advance the position by one and every symbol
    /// has moved down exactly one cell, seamlessly, forever.
    ///
    /// The version before this recycled cells -- moved the lowest to the top and gave
    /// it a new face. It looked right and it was wrong: once a cell has been moved, the
    /// array index no longer says where a cell *is*, so writing the landing symbols to
    /// indices 3, 4 and 5 scattered them up and down the belt. With fixed cells, 3, 4
    /// and 5 are the window, always, and that class of bug cannot happen.
    ///
    /// ## Stopping on the answer
    ///
    /// The server decided every stop before the first frame drew, so the total travel
    /// is rounded to a whole number of cells and the landing symbols are written into
    /// the strip **at the place the reel is going to rest on**. The reel then simply
    /// spins there. Nothing is swapped in at the last moment and nothing appears.
    ///
    /// The spin is theatre over a settled fact, which is the only honest way round:
    /// reels that chose their own stopping place would be reels the client could be
    /// made to lie with. Same arrangement as the roulette wheel.
