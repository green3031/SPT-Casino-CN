/// <summary>
/// The one piece of metadata for the whole casino, and the reason all four server
/// assemblies can live in a single folder.
///
/// ## Why there is exactly one
///
/// SPT loads a mod folder by taking **every** .dll in it -- `ModLoader.LoadMod` calls
/// `DirectoryInfo.GetFiles()`, filters on the extension and loads each one into a
/// single `SptMod.Assemblies` -- and `RegisterSptServicesAsync` then walks that whole
/// list, so every `[Injectable]` in every assembly is registered. Four assemblies from
/// one folder is not a trick; it is what the loader already does.
///
/// What it will not tolerate is two of these. `ModLoader.LoadModMetadata` runs
/// `SingleOrDefault` over the types implementing `IModMetadata` and throws
/// "Duplicate mod metadata found for mod at path" the moment it sees a second. That is
/// the whole constraint: **one folder, one metadata, as many assemblies as you like.**
///
/// So Blackjack, Poker and Roulette no longer carry one each. They keep their own
/// version numbers, in `TableInfo`, because those describe the table rather than the
/// download.
