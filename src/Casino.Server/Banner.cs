/// ## Why this does not go through the logger
///
/// `ISptLogger.LogWithColor` takes one colour for a whole line, which is as far as it
/// goes -- and embedding markup in the message does not work either, because
/// `ConsoleLogHandler.GetColorizedText` runs `Markup.Escape` over it first and the
/// tags would print as text. A letter at a time means writing to the console directly.
///
/// ## What that costs, and why it is affordable
///
/// These lines no longer reach `spt*.log`. That would matter -- the version is the
/// first thing worth knowing when somebody reports a problem -- except SPT already
/// writes it there itself:
///
///     Mod: SPT Casino version: 1.2.0 (GUID: com.mybutthasarash.sptcasino | ...) loaded
///
/// So the file keeps the fact and the console gets the flourish. Debug level was the
/// other candidate for keeping a plain copy in the file, and it is not one: the log
/// holds Information, Warning and Critical and no Debug lines at all, so a line logged
/// there would appear nowhere.
