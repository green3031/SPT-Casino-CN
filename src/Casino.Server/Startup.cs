/// It used to be three, one per table, because it used to be three mods. It is one
/// mod, it installs into one folder and it registers under one GUID, so it says so
/// once. Three blocks introducing three tables was a mod author's view of the thing
/// printed at somebody who has not opened it yet.
///
/// The tables still have their own `Startup`, and each is silent unless its verbose
/// switch is on -- see any of them. Turn one on and its block comes back, underneath
/// this.
///
/// Ordered ahead of them on purpose: `PostLoad` against their `PostLoad + 1`, so the
/// headline is above the detail rather than buried in the middle of it.
