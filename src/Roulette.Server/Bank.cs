/// <summary>
/// Reads what the player has, and moves it.
///
/// Ported from Poker's, which was ported from Blackjack's. It walks item stacks
/// directly rather than going through `PaymentService`, because both of that service's
/// entry points derive the currency from a trader and neither can settle anything
/// denominated in dollars or euros.
///
/// Three lessons arrive with it, each paid for once already:
///
/// - **`AddItemToStash` can decline an item without throwing.** A full stash silently
///   swallows a payout, so the balance is compared either side of every move against
///   what was intended and the shortfall posted as mail rather than lost.
/// - **The response must come from `EventOutputHolder.GetOutput`.** A hand-built
///   `ItemEventRouterResponse` initialises nothing and `RemoveItemByCount` reaches
///   straight into `output.ProfileChanges[sessionId]`, so it throws *after* the items
///   have already gone. On Blackjack that surfaced as "not enough roubles" while the
///   stake had left the stash.
/// - **A debit that half-succeeds is the worst case**, so it says how much may already
///   be missing rather than reporting a bare failure.
///
/// The one thing roulette does harder than its siblings is splitting a payout. A
/// straight-up win returns 36 times the stake, so a 1,000,000 chip on a number pays
/// 36,000,000 -- thirty-six maximum rouble stacks -- where a poker cash-out was
/// usually one or two.
