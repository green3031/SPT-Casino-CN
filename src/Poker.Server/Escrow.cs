/// with real currency that has already left the stash, so without this a crash
/// mid-session takes the buy-in and leaves nothing behind.
///
/// This is where hold'em departs from Blackjack, whose escrow held a *stake* until a
/// hand settled and then dropped it. Here one buy-in is taken and the player then
/// holds a number that moves every hand, so what is recorded has to move with it. A
/// file that remembered only the buy-in would refund a player who had lost most of it
/// and rob one who had doubled up -- both silently, and both looking like a payout
/// bug rather than a bookkeeping one.
