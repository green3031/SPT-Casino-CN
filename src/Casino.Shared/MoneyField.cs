    /// TMP gives an input field a one-pixel caret in the text's own colour, which on a
    /// dark box at 1440p is not there as far as anybody is concerned. Making it visible
    /// takes three separate things, and the first two alone were not enough:
    ///
    /// * a caret several pixels wide, in an accent colour, blinking slowly enough to be
    ///   on most of the time;
    /// * **selecting the whole number on focus**, which paints a block exactly where the
    ///   click landed -- this is the part that actually answers "did my click work", and
    ///   it is also what a player wants, because clicking the stake means replacing it;
    /// * the field's own border lighting up, so the box looks focused even in the moment
    ///   between the caret's blinks.
    ///
    /// ## Separators move the caret, so the caret is counted in digits
    ///
    /// Inserting a comma to the left of the caret shifts every character after it. A
    /// caret kept by character index therefore walks backwards a place each time the
    /// number crosses a thousand -- which is exactly when somebody is still typing. So
    /// the position is converted to "how many digits are behind me", the text is
    /// reformatted, and the caret is put back after that many digits.
