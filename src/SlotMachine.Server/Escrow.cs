/// Records the stake the table is holding, and hands it back after a crash.
///
/// The table itself lives in memory on purpose -- a cloth with chips on it has no
/// business surviving a restart, and keeping it out of the profile means this mod
/// never changes the profile schema. The **stake** is a different matter: once the
/// wheel turns it is real currency that has already left the stash, and without a
/// record on disk a server killed mid-spin has taken it and paid nothing, with no way
/// for the next session to know it ever happened.
///
/// ## Blackjack's escrow, not Poker's
///
/// Poker takes one buy-in and hands the player a live stack that moves every hand, so
/// what it records has to move with it -- recording the buy-in and stopping would
/// refund a player who had lost most of it and rob one who had doubled up. None of
/// that applies here. The money is out of the wallet only between the debit and the
/// credit of a single spin, and **nothing happens in that window**, so what is owed
/// cannot drift from what was taken.
///
/// That makes this the simplest escrow of the three, and the shortest-lived. It is
/// still not optional: short is not zero, and it is the only window in this mod where
/// the player's money exists nowhere at all.
