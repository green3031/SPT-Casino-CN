.SYNOPSIS
    Packs the server mod into something that extracts straight into an SPT install.

.DESCRIPTION
    Produces SPT_Runtime/user/mods/Roulette/, matching the layout Blackjack ships, so
    the zip is extracted at the root of the install and lands where SPT looks.

    With -InstallPath it also builds the BepInEx client plugin against that install,
    stages it under BepInEx/plugins/Roulette with the card and chip art, and copies both
    halves in. Without it the zip is the server alone and is named -server-only,
    because the client cannot be compiled on a machine without the game: it targets
    net472 against Assembly-CSharp.dll and the spt-* DLLs, and 4.1.3's PluginValidator
    requires the major.minor of those references to match the running server.

.EXAMPLE
    # Anywhere. Server only.
    ./scripts/roulette/pack-mod.ps1

.EXAMPLE
    # On the box with the game: builds both halves, installs them, writes a full zip.
    ./scripts/roulette/pack-mod.ps1 -InstallPath 'H:\SPT4.1.X'
