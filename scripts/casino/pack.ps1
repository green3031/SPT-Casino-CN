.SYNOPSIS
    Builds SPT Casino and, with -InstallPath, installs it over a real SPT folder.

.DESCRIPTION
    Builds and installs the whole of SPT Casino: one plugin carrying every table,
    and the server mods they talk to.

    One folder each side. SPT loads every .dll in a mod folder into a single mod and
    registers the injectables from all of them, so the server assemblies sit
    together under user/mods/Casino. The one thing it will not tolerate is two
    IModMetadata classes in one folder, which is why exactly one of them declares it.

    The art is one folder. The three mods' asset trees were byte-identical everywhere
    they overlapped -- 59 of 61 files appear in more than one and not one of them
    differed -- so the union is safe and every table finds its own art beside the DLL
    without a line of it changing.

    -InstallPath also REMOVES the old per-game plugin folders. Leaving them installed
    gives a tab per retired game on the bar and a Harmony patch each on the same method, which is
    the single most likely way this upgrade goes wrong.
